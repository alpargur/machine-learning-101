1 - What different ways are there to train a Linear Regression model? Which method provides the best results?

2 - Performance Measures:
	- RMSE
	- MSE
	- R^2 -> [0, 1]

3 - Increasing feature count increases the computational complexity more than increasing the number of data points

4 - Polynomial regression: 

5 - Decision Tree Classification vs. Regression: 
Regression predicts a value instead of a class. And we don't minimize impurity instead we try to minimize the error function.

6 - Regression tree prediction looks like levels on a parabolic equation. y constants at certain intervals.


- Regression
- Polynomial regression
- Learning curve overfitting / underfitting
- Early stopping
