# 3. Classification

- **Confusion Matrix:** It confuses people.


- **Precision & Recall:** Can be calculated from confusion matrix.


- **F1:** Harmonic mean pf precision & recall, hence compared to regular mean it puts more weight on lower values.


- **Model threshold:** It changes the precision and recall rates of a model.


- **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve:** sensitivity / 1 - specificity


- **Multiclass Classification:** Systems work on classification where n_class > 2
  - SVM & linear classifiers are strictly binary.
  - Random forest can do multiclass classification.


- **Multilabel Classification:** Systems classify based on multiple metrics.
  - Classify images of numbers where n < 50 and n is prime.
