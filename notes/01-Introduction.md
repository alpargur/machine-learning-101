- One chapter each week
- Open discussions and exercises on site
- 4th April 14.00 programming test (on site)
- What is machine learning?
- Oral Exam dates (11.07 / 18.07 / 31.08 / 01.09)
  
- Artificial Intelligence
	1. Turing test
	2. ...
	3. Thinking rationally (outdated)

	- Computational Intelligence
		- Fuzzy logic
		- Artificial Neural Networks
		- Evolutionary Algorithms

- Deep Learning: Application of NNs consisting of multiple hidden layers.
- DL < ML < AI
- Data Mining: More statistical aspect and the preprocessing. Prior knowledge is seldom available. (Un)supervised learning is a part of Data Mining too.
