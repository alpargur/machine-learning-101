- Machine Learning course content and notebooks built upon the chapters of [Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras &TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/) / 2nd edition.
- Each chapter has its own branch to make the course progression clear.
- This course is offered at [Cologne University of Applied Sciences](https://www.th-koeln.de/studium/technische-informatik-master_1197.php) by Prof. Dr. Beate Rhein in Spring Semester 2023.

## Get Started
Pull repository and go to the root directory:
```shell
$ git clone
$ cd machine-learning-101
```
