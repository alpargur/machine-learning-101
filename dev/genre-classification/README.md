# Project: Genre Classification

## Goal
Development of a genre classifier to predict the genre of a given track based on the audio features.

## Data Collection
Data is collected via Spotify API.

## Genre
Spotify has a wide variety of genres. As a PoC, we decided to develop a classifier for a small set of genres:
- rap, rock, metal, blues, jazz, classical, funk, techno, electronic, r&b
